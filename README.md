## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

### Training

1. Prepare your dataset in YOLO format (images and corresponding `.txt` files with annotations).  
2. Update the configuration file (`data.yaml`) with class names and dataset paths.  
3. Train the model:  
   ```bash
   python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data data.yaml --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
   ```

### Inference

1. Run the detection script:  
   ```bash
   python detect.py --source your_input_file --weights best.pt --img 640
   ```
2. Visualize detected objects in the output files.
